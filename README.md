# cpp_csvs

Initial draft -- a failed attempt to get both CSV and multithreading into the application at the same time, but it turns out that the way I'm doing it is less than optimal -- increasing threads means lower performance.

I'll revisit this later. Currently, the CSV portion works for a large data set, similar to my go_csvs and python_csv repos, but the multithreading still needs work.
